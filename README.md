## What is the meaning of this?!

**So** glad you're here. This is **the** GitHub profile of Marisa Marion Mackenzie (@marisaintheflesh)! ^_^;;

I'm just some techno-nerd on the internet. There's techno-babble source code, abandoned vapourware source code and placeholder repositories, weird strange odd source code, and a whole bunch of hidden private source code.

(I'll get around to cleaning up the private source code repositories and setting them to public eventually!...maybe...if I get to it...don't depend on it...ya...)

## Links?! Like snausage links?! Symbolic links?! Paper links?! Chain links?!

No. Hyperlinks.

## But...but...who are you? Where did you come from? Where did you go?!

I'm just some gal, ya know?!

Don't think too hard about it, it honestly sincerely might hurt your brain. I'm a whole can-o'-worms!

## Parting words! Those are the best words!

I know, right? It's like I words good.

Take a peak around, see what ya find...or don't, whatever, it's fine! This is the internet, I don't tell you what to do.
